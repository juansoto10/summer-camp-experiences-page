# Summer Camp Experiences Page

This project was developed using JavaScript to show the experiences dynamically  by manipulating DOM content. The information is obtained by using a JS Object that contains the data.

The layout is made using HTML5 and TailwindCSS to style the site and make a responsive design.

This website allows users to read and comment on the experiences of students who went to summer camps in the United States. They can also read a guide, ask questions, or share their own stories.
